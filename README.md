Update of the quill-reactive project to support live editing

This package is currently version 0.0.x, suitable for community testing and feedback. See the todos section below for development plans.

# quillReactive

Helpers for QuillJS rich text (WYSIWYG) editor, with live editing similar to Google Docs or Etherpad.

See this example: http://quill-reactive-ot.meteor.com

To add it to your project:

`meteor add jonlachlan:quill-reactive`

To use the `quillReactive` template, provide arguments for collectionName, docId and field.

```
 {{> quillReactive collection="myCollection" docId=docId field="fieldName"}}
```

Note that `collection` should be the MongoDB collection name, not the global variable.

## About

Quill uses `ottypes rich-text` for performing operational transform (OT) on changes to rich text. It also has terrific modules such as toolbars, undo manager, authorship highlighting, and multiple cursors.

### Live Editing

This package combines the features of Quill with the data reactivity of Meteor. The result is a text editor that has the same live editing features as Google Docs and Etherpad.

Live edits are optional, so you can also work on drafting changes without, and saving whenever you are ready.

### Offline Edits and Late Updates

You can also make offline edits, which are seamlessly re-integrated when you get back online.

### Drafts

QuillReactive uses a persistent Session variable, so drafts are not lost if the user reloads the page.

## Todos

* Customizable settings helpers (e.g., toolbar buttons)
* Styling support for UI frameworks such as Bootstrap and Semantic UI
* Default options for authorship and multiple cursors
* Improve documentation for various usage possibilities
